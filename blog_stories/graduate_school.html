                    The breakdown is the following: Non-academic and Academic factors.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Non-academic factors: Remember, a PhD is a commitment, meaning that you will spend somewhere around 4-6 years in 
                    a high-stress environment. This means that the environment you put yourself in will dictate many aspects of your life,
                    including your physical and mental well-being. So take a step back, and ask yourself, <i>what does my ideal environment look like?</i>
                    I suggest trying to answer this list of preliminary questions:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Location</b>: Is weather a big factor to you? Do you want to live somewhere that snows a lot?
                            Do you prefer a more tropical setting?
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Logistics</b>: Is the place walkable? Do you need a car? 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Personal</b>: Do you want to be close to your family? Say, a flight away? Or maybe not, you may prefer
                            being on the other side of the world XD.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lifestyle</b>: Do you want to live in a big city? Or would you rather live in a smaller college town?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p>
                    Academic factors: I suggest trying to answer this list of preliminary questions:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Ranking</b>: Is this school known at the national/international level?
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Advisor</b>: This one can be tricky. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lab</b>: Ask many questions
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Resources</b>: Do you want to live in a big city? Or would you rather live in a smaller college town?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p>Feel free to ask me more questions along the way. If you read this and got into a graduate school, then let
                    me know which school you got into!
