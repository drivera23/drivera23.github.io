                    First and foremost, its great that you are considering graduate school! This new chapter in your life will bring a lot of
                    unique and wonderful experiences for growth. However, these experiences can be brutaly different depending on the school you go to. With
                    that being said, now the fun part begins, which is picking a school to apply and attend. I personally do not know how <i>you</i> go about making decisions, but I like to make a list
                    of pros and cons that can help me create concrete arguments. There are so many factors that can help us pick a graduate school,
                    and I want to help you do that. I consider that the factors that go behing your decision can be broadly categorized into 2 groups: Non-academic and Academic factors.
                    Lets look at both of them!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Non-academic factors: A PhD is a commitment, meaning that you will spend somewhere around 4-6 years of your life in 
                    a high-stress environment. This means that the environment you put yourself in will dictate many aspects of <i>how</i> you live life,
                    including your physical and mental well-being. So take a step back, and ask yourself, <i>what does my ideal environment look like?</i>
                    I suggest trying to answer this list of preliminary questions:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Weather</b>: <i>Do you want to live somewhere that snows a lot or do you prefer a more tropical setting? 
                            Do you want to live in a place that has totally different weather than your home? </i> This may not be a deal breaker, but take factors like
                            the infamous <i>seasonal depression</i> into consideration. Some people tend to let their environments dictate their moods, and if you think this 
                            applies to you, be sure to maximize the number of schools that ultimately meet your criteria.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Logistics</b>: Imagine that you are moving to your university's city. In most cases, you will live outside of the campus. This means that you will
                            be responsible for finding an apartment, commuting to the university and back, cooking, laundry, etc. I suggest you ask yourself whether
                            the city your school has the following: Public transportation (e.g. Bus, trains, etc.), <i>somewhat</i> affordable housing near the campus, 
                            number of nearby pharmacies, hospitals, grocery stores, etc. Remember that, above any academic reasoning, it is crucial that you
                            take care of yourself, and by answering these questions, you will put yourself in the best position to find the ideal place.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Personal</b>: It is strongly encouraged to go to a graduate school located in a different place from where you did your undergraduate degree. 
                            Of course, if that is your case, this implies that you will leave your current home and move somehwere else. This also means that you will 
                            leave family and friends behind. So ask yourself the following: <i> do you want to be close to your family? Say, a flight away? Or do you want to go to 
                                the other side of the world? Do you want to be in a place with similar cultural background?</i>  
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lifestyle</b>: Do you want to live in a big city? Or would you rather live in a smaller college town? Some people enjoy
                            a vibrant and electrifying city with a lot of things to do. On the other hand, people also enjoy a smaller town.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p>
                    Academic factors: I suggest trying to answer this list of preliminary questions:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Ranking</b>: Check websites like US News and similar to get an idea of your school's reputation (In the case of CS students, 
                            CSRankings is good list). Of course, 
                            it is important to stress that ranking does NOT equal your 'ideal school'. However, higher ranked schools tend to have a wide range
                            of connections, and possibly more sources of funding for research.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Advisor</b>: When applying to a school, you're going to have to nominate a handful of 'potential advisors' 
                            (typically ranges from 2-5). A general rule of thumb is to google search <i>"[XYZ university] graduate research area and groups"</i>
                            and do the following: Find a research group that interests you, look at the Professors who work at the lab, visit their homepages,
                            Google Scholar sites, among other materials, and determine which one works on problems that YOU like. At least from my experience, when I got
                            admitted to a graduate school, the offer letter included the name of an advisor.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lab</b>: Ask many questions
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Resources</b>: Does your potential lab and advisor have any collaboration with other areas? 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p> Feel free to ask me more questions along the way. If you read this and got into a graduate school, then let
                    me know which school you got into!
