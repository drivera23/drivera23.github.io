                    First and foremost, it is great that you are considering doing a PhD! This new chapter in your life will bring a lot of
                    unique and wonderful experiences. However, these experiences can be brutaly different depending on the school you go to. With
                    that being said, now the fun part begins, which is picking a school to apply and attend. I personally do not know how <i>you</i> go about making decisions, but I like to make a list
                    of pros and cons that can help me create concrete arguments. There are so many factors that can help us pick a graduate school,
                    and I want to help you do that. I consider that the factors that go behing your decision can be broadly categorized into 2 groups: Non-academic and Academic factors.
                    Lets look at both of them!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Non-academic factors: A PhD is a commitment, meaning that you will spend somewhere around 4-6 years of your life in 
                    a high-stress environment. The environment you put yourself in will dictate many aspects of <i>how</i> you live life,
                    including your physical and mental well-being. So take a step back, and ask yourself, <i>what does my ideal environment look like?</i>
                    I suggest trying to answer this list of preliminary questions and topics:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Weather</b>: <i>Do you want to live somewhere that snows a lot or do you prefer a more tropical setting? 
                            Do you want to live in a place that has totally different weather than your home? </i> This may not be a deal breaker, but take factors like
                            the infamous <i>seasonal depression</i> into consideration. Some people tend to let their environments dictate their moods (for both good and bad), and if you think this 
                            applies to you, be sure to maximize the number of schools that ultimately meet your weather criteria.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Logistics</b>: Imagine yourself moving to your university's city. In most cases, you will live outside of the campus. This means that you will
                            be responsible for finding an apartment, commuting to the university and back, cooking, laundry, etc. I suggest you ask yourself whether
                            the city your school is located in has the following: Public transportation (e.g. Bus, trains, etc.), <i>somewhat</i> affordable housing near the campus, 
                            nearby pharmacies, hospitals, grocery stores, etc. Remember that, above any academic reasoning, it is crucial that you
                            take care of yourself. Living in a place that facilitates mosts of these concerns will put you in the best position to maximize your time on and off academic work.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Personal</b>: In most scenarios, it is strongly encouraged to go to a graduate school located in a different place from where you did your undergraduate degree. 
                            Of course, if that is your case, this implies that you will leave your current home and move somehwere else. This also means that you will 
                            leave family and friends behind. So ask yourself the following: <i> do you want to be close to your family? Say, a flight away? Or do you want to go to 
                                the other side of the world? Do you want to be in a place with similar cultural background?</i>. Though I might write another post 
                                debating this, there is nothing more important than finding your support system once you begin your PhD. And naturally, it is easier for someone
                                to develop a sense of belonging if you are sorrounded by people who share common experiences. Consider whether you want to be close to family, 
                                friends, and try to get a feel of your university's social life (try checking Reddit or other platforms to see what students think).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lifestyle</b>: <i>Do you want to live in a big city? Or would you rather live in a smaller college town?</i> This is also a very 
                           personal matter for most people. I've met individuals who enjoy a vibrant and electrifying city with a lot of things to do. 
                           On the other hand, some individuals also enjoy a smaller town, where they can settle down and focus on other things. Another 
                          trend I have noticed is that individuals who completed their undergraduate degrees in a small town do their PhD in a bigger city, and vice versa.
                          A lot of variables come into play for this one, the most important being the PhD stipend. Make sure to thoroughly determine whether your stipend 
                          allows you to live a <i>somehwat</i> comfortable life. I personally think that doing a PhD in a big city is great due to the fact that 
                          there are probably a handful of neighboring schools and companies, which in turn create an intellectualy and socially stimulating environment.

                    Academic factors: When considering a PhD program, academic factors play a pivotal role in shaping your academic journey and future career prospects. 
                    The reputation and research focus of the institution, as well as the expertise of potential advisors, can significantly impact the quality and relevance of 
                    your doctoral experience. Additionally, factors such as funding opportunities, facilities, and access to resources are crucial considerations in selecting 
                    the right school for your academic pursuits. Moreover, the alignment of your research interests with those of the faculty and the overall academic environment 
                    can greatly enhance your learning experience and scholarly growth. Thus, carefully evaluating these academic factors ensures that you choose a PhD program that 
                    not only meets your academic ambitions but also nurtures your intellectual curiosity and facilitates your professional development. I suggest trying to answer 
                    this list of preliminary questions and topics:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Ranking</b>: Check websites like US News and similar to get an idea of your school's reputation (In the case of CS students, 
                            CSRankings is good list). Of course, 
                            it is important to stress that ranking does NOT equal your 'ideal school'. However, higher ranked schools tend to have a wide range
                            of connections, and possibly more sources of funding for research. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Advisor</b>: When applying to a school, you're going to have to nominate a handful of 'potential advisors' 
                            (typically ranges from 2-5). A general rule of thumb is to google search <i>"[XYZ university] graduate research area and groups"</i>
                            and do the following: Find a research group that interests you, look at the Professors who work at the lab, visit their homepages,
                            Google Scholar sites, among other materials, and determine which one works on problems that YOU like. One extra step you can take is to reach 
                            out to their current students, and ask them about their experiences with said advisor. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Lab</b>: The lab environment and its culture play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of a PhD. 
                          Beyond the technical expertise, the lab serves as a crucible for innovation and collaboration, fostering an 
                          atmosphere where ideas flourish. A vibrant lab culture cultivates an ecosystem of intellectual exchange, 
                          where researchers engage in spirited discussions, critique each other's work, and offer invaluable insights. Moreover, 
                          the lab provides essential resources and support systems (i.e. colleagues, friends), from access to relevant technology to mentorship from seasoned researchers. In essence, the lab's 
                          culture acts as a cornerstone of success, imbuing students with the resilience, creativity, and community they need to 
                          thrive in the dynamic landscape of academia.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Reach and Collaborations</b>: Outisde of the lab and ranking, a good school must foster a culture of collaboration, 
                          both within the institution and beyond its walls. Interdisciplinary collaborations enable students to leverage diverse 
                          perspectives and expertise, catalyzing innovation and pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Additionally, mentorship from different faculty 
                          members and peer support networks provide crucial guidance and encouragement throughout the PhD. By cultivating a nurturing 
                          environment rich in resources and collaborations, schools empower aspiring computer scientists to thrive and make meaningful contributions 
                          to the field. This is a great talking point if you reach out to a potential advisor.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 

                <p style="padding-top:20px"> I hope this breakdown can be of use when you apply to PhD programs. I will probably
                  update this list and add more things that I think are important to consider. 
                  However, feel free to ask me more questions along the way. If you read this and got into a PhD program, then let
                    me know which school you got into!
